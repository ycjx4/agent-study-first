> **1984**, educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom published a finding that shook the academic world: a student who receives **1-on-1 tutoring** with **mastery-based progression** outperforms **98% of students** in traditional classrooms. He called it the **2-sigma problem** — because the effect was two standard deviations above the mean.
>
> The catch? One tutor per student doesn't scale. For decades, this remained an unsolved problem. **Until now.**

## What is this?

**2sigma** is a skill for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Codex](https://openai.com/index/codex/), and other AI agents. It turns your AI into a **Bloom-style private tutor** that:

- **Asks YOU questions** instead of waiting for you to ask — because when you're learning something new, you don't know what you don't know
- **Writes structured learning documents** to your local files — not trapped in a chat window that expires
- **Tracks your progress** with a knowledge tree — pick up where you left off, anytime
- **Adapts to your level** — struggling? it slows down. breezing through? it challenges you

### Why not just chat with AI?

Because chatting with AI gets the learning loop **backwards**.

|  | Traditional AI Chat | 2sigma |
|---|---|---|
| Who drives? | You ask, AI answers | **AI tutors, you respond** |
| Context | Chat dies after long conversations | **Files persist forever** |
| Progress | None. Start over every session. | **Knowledge tree + mastery tracking** |
| Difficulty | One-size-fits-all | **Adapts to YOUR comprehension** |
| Science | None | **Bloom's 2-sigma method** |

## How it works

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/learning-loop.png" alt="2sigma learning loop" width="500"/>
</p>

1. You say: **"Help me learn quantum computing"**
2. AI asks about your background and level
3. Generates `01.md` — written like a friend explaining, not a textbook lecturing
4. You answer questions at the end (designed to test *understanding*, not *memory*)
5. AI evaluates your overall comprehension, not just right/wrong
6. Generates `02.md` — adapted based on your answers
7. Repeat until mastery

## 6 Learning Modes

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/six-modes.png" alt="Six learning modes" width="700"/>
</p>

| Mode | Trigger | What it does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Paper Reading** | "Help me read this paper" + PDF/DOI | Breaks down a research paper into digestible pieces |
| **Concept Learning** | "What is X?" / "Explain X" | Takes one concept from zero to mastery |
| **Domain Introduction** | "I want to learn about X field" | Builds a complete knowledge map with learning roadmap |
| **Tech Stack** | "How do I learn X framework?" | Understands a tool's philosophy and core usage |
| **Code Repo Reading** | Provide a GitHub URL or local path | Reads a codebase like reading a paper — architecture first, details on demand |
| **Exam Review** | "Quiz me on this book" + PDF/textbook | Progressive testing with weak-area drilling — feed it a whole book |

## The secret sauce

Most AI "tutors" ask you to recite what you just read. That's useless.

2sigma designs questions as a **confidence sandwich**:

1. **Accessible** — You can answer this. Builds confidence. But you must rephrase, not copy.
2. **Application** — Apply the concept to a scenario the document never mentioned.
3. **Challenge** (optional) — Synthesize, evaluate, or argue. Only when you're ready.

The AI evaluates your **overall comprehension**, not individual answers. Small mistakes get corrected and you move on. Fundamental misunderstandings trigger a re-teach from a different angle.

### Your Knowledge Tree

2sigma builds a **knowledge tree** as you learn. You always know exactly where you are:

- **Green nodes** = mastered topics (you've proven you understand them)
- **Coral node** = what you're learning right now
- **Gray dashed nodes** = upcoming topics (locked until prerequisites are done)

Pick up where you left off, anytime. Your progress never gets lost.

## Install

#### Claude Code

Or just tell Claude Code:

> Help me clone `https://github.com/chenly255/2sigma` to `~/.claude/skills/2sigma/`

Or run it yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chenly255/2sigma.git ~/.claude/skills/2sigma
```

#### Codex

Tell Codex:

> Clone `https://github.com/chenly255/2sigma` to `~/.codex/skills/2sigma/`

Or run it yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chenly255/2sigma.git ~/.codex/skills/2sigma
```

#### Other agents (Trae, etc.)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chenly255/2sigma.git
# Copy SKILL.md and references/ to wherever your agent reads skill files
```

### PDF support (optional)

To feed PDFs (papers or textbooks), install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

First PDF conversion auto-downloads models. Subsequent runs use cache.

## First time setup

On first use, the skill asks a few questions to personalize your experience:

- **Language** — responds in whatever language you prefer
- **Your background** — so it picks analogies that click for you
- **Document length** — short (600w), medium (1000w), or long (1800w)
- **Paper source** — Zotero, PDF files, or online search

Saved once. Never asked again unless you want to change them.

## Extending

Want to add a new learning mode? See [references/extending.md](references/extending.md). Define trigger words, document sequence, and style rules. The mastery loop handles the rest.
